{-| On `Failure`, the program should return an exit code of `1`.
On success it should return an exit code of `0` (in optionsParser line interfaces,
`0` exit status means success, non-zero means there was an error).
Possible reasons for error include optionsParser not found, validtion error in optionsParser, etc.
See the examples folder for Elm optionsParser line programs with an end-to-end setup.
